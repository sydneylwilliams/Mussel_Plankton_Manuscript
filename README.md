Benthic grazers and suspension feeders, such as oysters and mussels, may play a disproportionate role in controlling algal biomass as well as microplankton community composition in estuarine systems. Nonetheless, their effects on microplankton communities remain poorly understood across environmental contexts and in real-world settings, in part from a paucity of in situ measurements. Here, we conduct in situ manipulative field experiments to evaluate the effects of the Atlantic ribbed mussel, Geukensia demissa, on bulk chlorophyll a (µg L-1); absolute cell abundance (individuals mL-1) of microplankton groups (i.e., pennate and centric diatoms, dinoflagellates, and heterotrophic microzooplankton); and relative cell abundance (%) of microplankton trophic levels (i.e., auto-, mixo-, and heterotrophic) across three salt marsh sites in the southeastern U.S. (GA and FL). Irrespective of site-specific conditions, mussels efficiently grazed on plankton to depleted bulk chlorophyll a concentrations and absolute cell abundances. At two of the three sites, mussels also shifted microplankton community composition toward a structure made up of substantially smaller proportions of autotrophs and larger proportions of mixotrophs. Given the essential role of the microplankton community in mediating the ecological and geochemical functioning of estuaries, our results highlight that – in real-world settings – mussels play a powerful role every tidal cycle in modifying such functions through their prolific and selective grazing on this community.
